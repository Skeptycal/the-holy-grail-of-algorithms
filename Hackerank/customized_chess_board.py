Mary decides to paint a customized NxN chess board. Given the painted chess
board, can you tell if it is painted correctly or not? A chess board is considered
valid if every 2 adjacent cells are painted with a different color. Two cells
are considered adjacent if they share a boundary e.g.

            **********
            *    *****
            *    *****
            ****     *
            ****     *
            **********

            Figure 1
